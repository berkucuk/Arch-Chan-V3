## Architecture

The Arch Chan project is built upon a robust client-server architecture:

-   **`mcp_server.py` (Server)**:
    -   Acts as the central processing unit.
    -   Communicates with **Google Gemini AI** and processes AI responses.
    -   Handles prompt management and output parsing using **LangChain**.
    -   Analyzes incoming user messages and generates context-aware responses.
    -   Can execute Linux commands, provide system information, and perform special functions like file hashing.
    -   Manages multiple client connections concurrently using **threading**. Each client maintains its own chat history and language preference independently (for future development).
    -   Utilizes environment variables (`.env`) for security.
    -   Processes command execution requests via XML parsing.
    -   Server logging is crucial for monitoring operational status and potential issues.

-   **`gui_chatbot.py` (Client - GUI)**:
    -   Provides the visual interface for user interaction.
    -   Developed using **PyQt5**, offering a modern and interactive user experience.
    -   Sends user-typed messages to the server and displays responses received from the server.
    -   Enables text-to-speech functionality using **gTTS** (Google Text-to-Speech) and **Pygame**, allowing you to hear Arch Chan's voice. Volume control is available.
    -   Supports multiple languages and manages user language preferences.
    -   Visual details like the application icon enhance the user experience.
    -   Comprehensive error handling and logging are critical for identifying client-side issues.

These two main components ensure Arch Chan operates as a smooth and interactive AI assistant.
